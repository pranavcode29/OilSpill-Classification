# OilSpill-Classification

It is a Major Project Of Machine Learning which is given by Testbook Skill Academy to improve my knowledge of python and machine learning concepts.

In this Project I have used the OilSpill Dataset and performed Classification Algorthms of Machine Learning to know whether the patch contains an oil spill or not.

# ABOUT THE DATASET
The dataset was developed by starting with satellite images of the ocean,some of which contain an oilspill and some that do not.Images were split into sections and processed using computer vision algorithms to provide a vector of features to describe the contents of the image section or patch. The task is,given a vector that describes the contents of a patch of a satellite image,then predicts whether the patch contains an oil spill or not,e.g.from the illegal or accidental dumping of oil in the ocean.There are two classes and the goal is to distinguish between spill and non-spill using the features for a given ocean patch.

● Non-Spill : negative case, or majority class.

● Oil Spill : positive case, or minority class.

There are a total of 50 Columns in the Dataset , the output column is named as target.

# Things to do in this Assignment

●Download the Oil Spill Dataset and perform Data cleaning and Data Pre-Processing if Necessary.

●Use the various methods such as Handling nullvalues , One-HotEncoding, Imputation and Scaling of Data Pre-Processing where necessary.

●Derive some insights from the dataset.

●Apply various Machine Learning techniques to predict the output in target column, make use of Bagging and Ensemble as required and find the best model by evaluating the model using Model evaluation techniques.

●Save the best model and Load the model

●Take the original dataset and make another dataset by randomly picking 20 datapoints from the oil spill dataset and apply the saved model on the same.
